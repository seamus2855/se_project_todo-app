# Simple Todo App

Project app where we incorporate different ways to put together an app with different validations. 

## Functionality

When it comes to the app it took different skills with working with addlisteners as well as incorporating modals to make the app successful. I had to make different validations to make sure everything works when opened and then when it closes. There was different parts throughout making the app that included reset as well as generate all these parts to make everything run smoothly.

## Technology

This project had me using different Javascript as well as other techniques we learn in the lessons. It helped when it comes to moving from each section and incorporating different validations as well as the normal techniques. I had to do different ways to make topics work as well as being able to open/close with using keyboard as well as buttons. I had to look up what I had to do in past lessons as well as google to see what are different terms for each way of doing different valids as well as different ways of making the app work.
